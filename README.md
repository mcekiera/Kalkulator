#Calculator

<i>My first finished Java project.</i>

Simple calculator with basic features:
- basic math operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide,
- operations on negative numbers, percents
- exponentiation to nth and 2nd root,
- simple memory 
- variable level of decimal precision,
- history of results,
- wrapping of input line,
- current and full equatation (with order of operations) solving modes.

Whole code put in one extremely complicated class. Very important lesson for future, to never do that again,
a nightmare to modify and maintain.

All operations are based on BigDecimal class.
